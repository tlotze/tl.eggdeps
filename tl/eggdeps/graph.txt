Computing the dependency graph
==============================

Specifying the working set
==========================

When a graph is instantiated without any working set given, it will use the
global working set of active distributions defined by pkg_requires:

>>> import tl.eggdeps.graph
>>> graph = tl.eggdeps.graph.Graph()
>>> sorted(graph.working_set)
[...tl.eggdeps ... setuptools ... zope.testing ...]
