0.3.1
=====

In version 0.3.1, a bug involving omissions in the plaintext output was found:
If a subtree was omitted, siblings following its mount point were skipped.
This is how it should work:

>>> from tl.eggdeps.graph import Graph
>>> anton = make_dist("anton-1.egg", depends="""berta
...                                             charlie""")
>>> berta = make_dist("berta-2.egg", depends="""charlie
...                                             emil""")
>>> charlie = make_dist("charlie-1.4.egg", depends="dora")
>>> dora = make_dist("dora-0.5.egg")
>>> emil = make_dist("emil-1.egg")
>>> ws = make_working_set(anton, berta, charlie, dora, emil)
>>> graph = Graph(working_set=ws)
>>> graph.from_specifications("anton")

>>> from tl.eggdeps.plaintext import print_graph
>>> print_graph(graph, Options())
anton
    berta
        charlie
            dora
        emil
    charlie ...

>>> print_graph(graph, Options(once=True))
anton
    berta
        charlie
            dora
        emil
        ...

>>> print_graph(graph, Options(terse=True))
anton
    berta
        charlie
            dora
        emil
    charlie


0.3.2
=====

In version 0.3.2 it was discovered that the graph wouldn't work reliably if
the name of a distribution occured with different capitalization in different
places. Since distribution names are supposed to be case-insensitive, the
following should work as expected:

>>> anton_1 = make_dist("anton-1.egg", depends="berta")
>>> berta_2 = make_dist("Berta-2.egg")
>>> ws = make_working_set(anton_1, berta_2)
>>> graph = Graph(working_set=ws)
>>> graph.from_working_set()
>>> sprint(graph)
{'anton': {'berta': {None: set()}}, 'berta': {}}
>>> graph.roots
{'anton'}
