class Graph(dict):
    """A graph of egg dependencies.

    The nodes of the graph represent distributions (sometimes informally
    called 'packages' or 'eggs'). The edges represent dependencies.

    After creating a graph you need to populate it. To collect information
    about all installed packages, call:

        graph = Graph()
        graph.from_working_set()

    To get information about a subset of packages (and their dependencies),
    call:

        graph = Graph()
        graph.from_specifications('package1', 'package2')

    There are options for filtering the graph, described in the docstring of
    the constructor.

    To access a graph node, index the graph using the distribution name as the
    key.

        node = graph['zope.component']

    Setuptools has this notion of extra dependencies. These are optional and
    are grouped by feature names. For example, 'zope.component' has a 'test'
    extra that pulls in 'zope.testing' and 'zope.location'. Nodes are mappings
    of names of their dependencies to sets of extras by way of which the
    dependencies arise:

        list(nodes.iter_deps()) == [('zope.interface', set()),
                                    ('zope.testing', set(['test']))]
