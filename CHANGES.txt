========================
Changes between versions
========================

0.2.1
=====

User visible:
  - renamed the --print-version option to --version-numbers

  - In plain text output, print the names of extras above their dependencies
    instead of next to them, which happened to look as if they belonged to the
    dependency specifications themselves.

  - documented the meaning of annotations and colors in the output

  - made the script entry point recognize option defaults which can be set
    using the arguments option of the buildout egg recipe, for example

Bug fixes:

  - In plain text output, made sure that subtrees are printed at a path with
    extra dependencies occuring as late as possible, if at all.
